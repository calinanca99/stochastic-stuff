    "# Bayes' rule\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought about doing this after a video that I have seen from 3b1b. You can find the video [here](https://youtu.be/lG4VkPoG3ko).\n",
    "\n",
    "The video introduces the Bayes' rule and shows its applications to the relationship between the accuracy and predictability of a cancer test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' rule is one of the first things one learns in a probability theory class. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' rule helps answering the following kind of questions:\n",
    "- What is the probability of raining today *given* that it rained yesterdy?\n",
    "- What is the probability of a car being Italian *given* that it breaks every two months?\n",
    "\n",
    "And, based on the video from 3b1b:\n",
    "- What is the probability of having cancer given that the result is positive?\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's take a look!"

    "Firstly, it is useful to introduce some terms that are going to appear quite often:\n",
    "- **prevalence rate** a.k.a. how many people in the population have breast cancer?\n",
    "- **sensitivity** a.k.a *true positives rate* a.k.a how many out of the people that have breast cancer are identified as positives by the test?\n",
    "- **specificity** a.k.a. *true negatives rate* a.k.a how many out of the people that DO NOT have breast cancer are identified as negatives by the test?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a look at the problem presented in the video:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that 1% of the population has breast cancer. Also, it is known that given that a person has breast cancer the test is going to be positive 90% of the time. At the same it is known that given that person DOES NOT have breast cancer the test is going to be negative 91% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the quesion is: what is the chance that given that someone tested positive they actually have cancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "And the answer is... close to 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to get there."
